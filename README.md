# Just Give Me A Recipe

The ultimate way to simplify picking out meals for the week

## What is Just Give Me A Recipe?

In an effort to simplify the process of picking out meals for the week, I present Just Give Me A Recipe. Easily generate a list of meals instead of scouring the internet or cookbooks for recipes.

As an MVP, JGMAR will present you with a way to randomly generate a list of meals for the week based on the types of food you want to eat. It will also allow you to add your own custom recipes to the list to share with everyone.

## Technology Used

This is a MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node) application.

### Deployment and Hosting Details

TODO once MVP is deployed

## Contributing

Setting up the development environment is as having docker installed along with the remote containers VSCode extension. Once the project is opened, launch the development environment and start the Angular development server along with the Express API.

The development environment comes with everything pre-installed and will launch a MongoDB container automatically.
